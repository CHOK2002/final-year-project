                                                                                                                                                                                                Silicon Valley Bank collapsed Friday morning after a stunning 48 hours in which a bank run and a capital crisis led to the second-largest failure of a financial institution in US history. California regulators closed down the tech lender and put it under the control of the US Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The FDIC is acting as a receiver, which typically means it will liquidate the bank’s assets to pay back its customers, including depositors and creditors.  The FDIC, an independent government agency that insures bank deposits and oversees financial institutions, said all insured depositors will have full access to their insured deposits by no later than Monday morning. It said it would pay uninsured depositors an “advance dividend within the next week.” The bank, previously owned by SVB Financial Group, didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment. What happened? The wheels started to come off on Wednesday, when SVB announced it had sold a bunch of securities at a loss and that it would sell $2.25 billion in new shares to shore up its balance sheet. That triggered a panic among key venture capital firms, who reportedly advised companies to withdraw their money from the bank.  The company’s stock cratered on Thursday, dragging other banks down with it. By Friday morning, SVB’s shares were halted and it had abandoned efforts to quickly raise capital or find a buyer. Several other bank stocks were temporarily halted Friday, including First Republic, PacWest Bancorp, and Signature Bank. The mid-morning timing of the FDIC’s takeover was noteworthy, as the agency typically waits until the market has closed to intervene. “SVB’s condition deteriorated so quickly that it couldn’t last just five more hours,” wrote Better Markets CEO Dennis M. Kelleher. “That’s because its depositors were withdrawing their money so fast that the bank was insolvent, and an intraday closure was unavoidable due to a classic bank run.” Silicon Valley Bank’s decline stems partly from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive interest rate hikes over the past year.  When interest rates were near zero, banks loaded up on long-dated, seemingly low-risk Treasuries. But as the Fed raises interest rates to fight inflation, the value of those assets has fallen, leaving banks sitting on unrealized losses. Higher rates hit tech especially hard, undercutting the value of tech stocks and making it tough to raise funds, Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi said. That prompted many tech firms to draw down the deposits they held at SVB to fund their operations. “Higher rates have also lowered the value of their treasury and other securities which SVB needed to pay depositors,” Zandi said. ” All of this set off the run on their deposits that forced the FDIC to takeover SVB.”   Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo on Friday sought to reassure the public about the health of the banking system after the sudden collapse of SVB. “Federal regulators are paying attention to this particular financial institution and when we think about the broader financial system, we’re very confident in the ability and the resilience of the system,” Adeyemo told CNN in an exclusive interview.  The comments come after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened an unscheduled meeting of financial regulators to discuss the implosion of Silicon Valley Bank, a major lender to the hurting tech sector. “We have the tools that are necessary to [deal with] incidents like what’s happened to Silicon Valley Bank,” Adeyemo said. Adeyemo said US officials are “learning more information” about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. He argued the Dodd-Frank financial reform overhaul, signed into law in 2010, has given regulators the tools they need to address this and improved the capitalization of banks. Adeyemo declined to predict what, if any, impact there will be to the broader economy or the tech industry. Echoes of 2008 Despite initial panic on Wall Street over the run on SVB, which caused its shares to crater, analysts said the bank’s collapse is unlikely to set off the kind of domino effect that gripped the banking industry during the financial crisis.  “The system is as well-capitalized and liquid as it has ever been,” Zandi said. “The banks that are now in trouble are much too small to be a meaningful threat to the broader system.”   But smaller banks that are disproportionately tied to cash-strapped industries like tech and crypto may be in for a rough ride, according to Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.  “Everyone on Wall Street knew that the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign would eventually break something, and right now that is taking down small banks,” Moya said.  ‘Idiosyncratic situation’  While relatively unknown outside of Silicon Valley, SVB was among the top 20 American commercial banks, with $209 billion in total assets at the end of last year, according to the FDIC.  It’s the largest lender to fail since Washington Mutual collapsed in 2008.  The bank partnered with nearly half of all venture-backed tech and health care companies in the United States, many of which pulled deposits out of the bank. Mike Mayo, Wells Fargo senior bank analyst, said the crisis at SVB may be “an idiosyncratic situation.” “This is night and day versus the global financial crisis from 15 years ago,” he told CNN’s Julia Chatterly on Friday. Back then, he said, “banks were taking excessive risks, and people thought everything was fine. Now everyone’s concerned, but underneath the surface the banks are more resilient than they’ve been in a generation.” Rate hikes take a bite SVB’s sudden fall mirrored other risky bets that have been exposed in the past year’s market turmoil. Crypto-focused lender Silvergate said Wednesday it is winding down operations and will liquidate the bank after being financially pummeled by turmoil in digital assets. Signature Bank, another lender, was hit hard by the bank selloff, with shares sinking 30% before being halted for volatility Friday. “SVB’s institutional challenges reflect a larger and more widespread systemic issue: The banking industry is sitting on a ton of low-yielding assets that, thanks to the last year of rate increases, are now far underwater — and sinking,” wrote Konrad Alt, co-founder of Klaros Group. Alt estimated that rate increases have “effectively wiped out approximately 28% of all the capital in the banking industry as of the end of 2022.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            bank failures, banking institutions, banking, finance and investments, business closings, business, economy and trade, commercial banking, companies, company activities and management, company locations and facilities, company strategy, consumer banking, domestic alerts, domestic-business, economic policy, economy and economic indicators, federal deposit insurance corp, financial markets and investing, financing and stock offering, government organizations - us, iab-business, iab-business administration, iab-business and finance, iab-business banking & finance, iab-consumer banking, iab-economy, iab-financial industry, iab-industries, iab-interest rates, iab-large business, iab-personal finance, iab-technology & computing, interest rates, international alerts, international-business, monetary policy, silicon valley bank, technology, the fed, us federal departments and agencies, us government independent agencies  business                                          https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/10/investing/svb-bank/index.html\n",

just four days ago, and already jurors have heard testimony from one of his closest business partners who said, in essence, “we did the crimes, and we did them at SBF’s direction.”  Gary Wang, the co-founder of now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, is just the first of what is expected to be three key witnesses for the prosecution who will say under oath that the crypto firm’s leadership defrauded investors and stole from customers in a multibillion-dollar scheme involving FTX and its sister trading house, Alameda Research.  Over roughly six hours of testimony, Wang recounted FTX’s rise and fall with Bankman-Fried calling the shots on just about everything, including deceiving everyone outside of his inner circle about what was really happening at the firm.   Bankman-Fried, who has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy, stands alone in his view of his business empire’s collapse. Since his arrest in December last year, SBF has repeatedly sought to portray himself as a CEO who simply got in over his head. Things were “moving quickly” in the volatile world of crypto, his lead defense attorney, Mark Cohen, said in his opening statement Wednesday. They were “building the plane as they were flying it,” and some things were overlooked.  The defense has not yet presented its case in the trial, which could last up to six weeks. It remains unclear whether Bankman-Fried will testify.  Here are some highlights from the first week in court. Alameda’s special privileges  Two of the witnesses called so far are former FTX employees who testified on crucial aspects of the government’s case. Specifically, they explained to the jury how FTX and Alameda, which were ostensibly separate companies founded by Bankman-Fried, were effectively (secretly) deeply financially intertwined.  A simple way to think of it: Alameda was doing complex, highly risky bets in crypto markets (similar to a traditional hedge fund). FTX was the customer-facing business that was more straightforward — if you wanted to trade crypto, you just create an account, deposit some money on the platform and have at it. FTX made money by collecting fees on those trades.   The trouble is, FTX didn’t tell its customers that the money they sent to FTX was actually being held in a bank account controlled by Alameda. Furthermore, prosecutors said, the people running FTX were secretly letting Alameda use FTX as a slush fund from which it could borrow a virtually unlimited amount of money.  Complicating things a bit, Alameda also used FTX like other businesses and individual investors did. But Alameda was not a typical customer.  Wang, who pleaded guilty to financial crimes as part of a plea deal, testified that he personally wrote some of the computer code that allowed Alameda backdoor access to FTX money, including customer deposits.  He also said that Alameda had a $65 billion line of credit from FTX — a figure that was meant to be so big it couldn’t be breached. And Alameda was the only FTX customer allowed to carry a negative balance.  Bankman-Fried’s lawyers challenged Wang’s characterization of Alameda’s privileges, saying Alameda controlled the bank account that FTX funds were deposited to because FTX, the newer company, was having trouble finding a banking partner (a common obstacle for crypto firms). Defense counsel Christian Everdell, in cross-examining Wang, suggested that Alameda’s ability to go negative and take out a large line of credit were functional necessities related to its role as a “market maker” on FTX — rather than a nefarious plot. (Market makers are people or companies that help exchanges run smoothly by taking on the role of buyer or seller at various times.) Everdell pointed to past conversations in which Wang told prosecutors that the “allow negative” function was necessary to fulfilling Alameda’s role as a market maker.  What SBF said as FTX foundered Prosecutors are trying to demonstrate that Bankman-Fried not only stole customer funds to splurge on luxury real estate and private jet trips, but also that he lied to investors, clients and the public about all of it.  In November 2022, as customers began drawing down their FTX accounts en masse, Bankman-Fried tweeted that FTX and customer assets were “fine.” “FTX was not fine,” Wang said Friday. “Assets were not fine.”  FTX did not have enough assets to cover all its client holdings because Alameda had withdrawn all of it, he said.  Star witness coming Tuesday Caroline Ellison, Alameda’s former CEO and Bankman-Fried’s on-and-off girlfriend, is expected to take the stand when court resumes on Tuesday.   Ellison, 28, is considered the prosecution’s star witness, given her position as the head of Alameda and her personal knowledge of Bankman-Fried’s behavior. Like Wang, she pleaded guilty to several fraud charges as part of a plea deal.  One of the crucial moments prosecutors have said they will address with Ellison is an audio recording of a meeting in which Ellison tells Alameda employees that the fund borrowed money from FTX customer accounts to pay back lenders. According to court documents, when one employee asks who made the decision, Ellison responds: “Um … Sam, I guess.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   banking, finance and investments, brand safety-nsf crime, brand safety-nsf sensitive, business figures, business, economy and trade, companies, consumer loans and credit, court trials, court witnesses, crime, law enforcement and corrections, criminal law, digital currencies, domestic alerts, domestic-business, economy and economic indicators, ftx, iab-business, iab-business and finance, iab-business banking & finance, iab-crime, iab-currencies, iab-economy, iab-law, iab-personal debt, iab-personal finance, iab-personal loans, international alerts, international-business, law and legal system, law courts and tribunals, money, banknotes and coins, personal finance, sam bankman-fried, trial and procedure  business                  https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/06/business/takeaways-sbf-first-week-in-court/index.html\n",

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees to get on board with the company’s return-to-office plan or to consider employment elsewhere, the company confirmed to CNN, after a report by Insider highlighted Jassy’s remarks from a recent internal event.  Jassy’s message reflects Amazon’s continued pressure on US office staff to comply with a policy requiring them to report to a physical office at least three days a week.  As part of his remarks, which Amazon shared with CNN, Jassy said during the event this month that while employees are entitled to disagree with the company’s decision bringing workers back into the office and to criticize it, they are not entitled to disregard the policy.  He also predicted that for those who could not accept the policy, their prospects for remaining at Amazon appeared grim.  Some people posting to message boards on site likes Reddit and Blind in recent weeks discuss legal rights for employees who say they were hired 12 months earlier as a virtual employee and whether they can be forced to work in an office.  Earlier, Insider reported that a recording of the session depicted Jassy telling recalcitrant employees: “It’s probably not going to work out for you.” Insider also reported that employees at the internal meeting asked Jassy to produce the internal data justifying the policy. According to the remarks Amazon shared with CNN, Jassy responded by saying that the return-to-office policy was more the result of a judgment call based on an assessment of various factors including business results. He added that Amazon had little data to support a policy of indefinite remote work, and that Amazon had to make judgment calls based on limited data in the past.  The remarks also showed that Insider accurately reported Jassy’s predictions regarding employees who do not comply with the return-to-office mandate. (CNN was permitted to paraphrase, but not directly quote from, Jassy’s remarks.)  Separately, the company told CNN that Amazon had all along emphasized that its approach to remote work would evolve along with pandemic conditions. Earlier this month, Amazon sent some employees an email indicating that the company knew they were not badging into the office as often as required.  Amazon’s signal to workers that it is tracking their attendance comes after hundreds of its corporate employees staged a walkout in May to protest the office policy. At the time, organizers of the walkout said more than 1,000 employees had participated in the event; Amazon disputed that figure, claiming that only 300 were involved. Organizers of the walkout have called the company’s approach a “rigid, one-size-fits-all” mandate.

Jeļena Ostapenko extended her impressive unbeaten record over world No. 1 Iga Świątek on Sunday, eliminating the defending US Open champion in the round of 16 at Flushing Meadows. The sheer power from the big-hitting Ostapenko once again proved too much for Świątek, with the Latvian winning 3-6 6-3 6-1 to improve to 4-0 in their head-to-head record. Ostapenko, the 20th seed in New York, struck 31 winners en route to her victory, ending Świątek’s 75-week run as world No. 1. Belarus’ Aryna Sabalenka is set to take over top spot for the first time after the US Open. “I think the main thing is she doesn’t really like to play big hitters,” Ostapenko told reporters after her win. “She likes to have some time. When I play fast, aggressive and powerful, she’s a little bit in trouble. “I always expect a tough battle against Iga, she is such a great player and very consistent … but I just went for it. I know I had to play my game and be aggressive because that is not what she likes.” After losing the opening set, Ostapenko then went on to dominate the match and hurried to a remarkable 5-0 lead in the deciding third set.  Świątek, who was yet to drop a set at this year’s tournament, managed to avoid one of the bagels that she so often hands out to opponents, but there was ultimately nothing she could do to halt Ostapenko’s power and precision. “I’m surprised that my level changed so drastically,” Świątek told reporters. “Usually when I play bad, I play bad at the beginning, then I catch up or problem solve. This time, it was totally the opposite. “I don’t really know what happened with my game. I felt no control suddenly.” Coco Gauff marches on in New York Ostapenko, the 2017 French Open champion, will play Coco Gauff in the quarterfinals after the teenager beat the returning Caroline Wozniacki 6-3 3-6 6-1. Gauff, who had to come back from a break down in the third set, won the biggest title of her career in Cincinnati ahead of the US Open and has continued her fine form in New York. The sixth seed and one of the favorites to lift the title in an open field, Gauff is bidding to reach a second grand slam final and her first on home soil. Her victory ended Wozniacki’s remarkable return to the sport after the Dane retired three and a half years ago to start a family. This was Wozniacki’s first appearance at a grand slam since the 2020 Australian Open after only returning to the tour last month. Wozniacki’s run at Flushing Meadows, during which she eliminated 11th seed Petra Kvitová, will no doubt fill her with confidence ahead of the new season. “There’s a lot of positives to take with me going forward. I’m on the right track,” Wozniacki, the 2018 Australian Open champion, said. “I’m finding my form, I’m finding my feet. I’m excited to take on more events and more players.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               caroline wozniacki, iab-sports, iab-tennis, sports figures     sport  https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/04/tennis/iga-swiatek-loses-jelena-ostapenko-us-open-spt-intl/index.html\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       The Biden administration has taken mixed positions on its policies involving Haiti – with one federal agency warning that the Caribbean country is too dangerous for US citizens, while another agency deports Haitians back to the violence-torn country. Violence in Haiti during the second quarter of 2023 jumped almost 14% when compared to the previous quarter, according to a United Nations report released Thursday.  On August 30, the US Embassy in Haiti urged American citizens to leave the country due to the “current security situation.” The next day, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deported an undisclosed number of individuals to Haiti. With Haiti’s capital Port-au-Prince largely controlled by gangs infamous for kidnapping and murder, experts warn that the deportations could amount to death sentences. “This act puts lives in danger,” Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, said in a statement. “We urgently call upon President Biden, Vice President Harris, Secretary Mayorkas, and the entire administration to cease all deportations to Haiti.” Waves of crime and unrest have hit Haiti since the assassination of former President Jovenel Moise in 2021. His successor, Prime Minister Ariel Henry, has struggled to staunch the violence. More than 1,860 victims of killings, injuries, and kidnappings were documented between April 24 and June 30, 2023, the UN report said. Nevertheless, Haiti was among the top three destinations for charter flight deportations from the US during the 2022 fiscal year, with 125 flights conducted during that time, according to ICE’s annual report.   In recent years, the US has deported more than 2,700 Haitians, with 895 deported in fiscal year 2020, 353 in fiscal year 2021 and 1,532 in fiscal year 2022, according to the same report. Citing the Biden administration’s expansion of legal pathways for Haitians, a White House National Security Council spokesperson told CNN in a statement that Haitians seeking to enter the United States are urged to do so legally. The US Departments of State and of Homeland Security “monitor the situation on the ground and coordinate closely with international partners to ensure migrants can be safely returned to Haiti,” the spokesperson also said.   For months, Henry and the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres have called for a military intervention in the country. But Haiti’s neighbors in the Western Hemisphere have quietly declined a leading role. In late July, the government of Kenya offered to lead a “multi-national force” of 1,000 police officers to help train and assist Haitian police “restore normalcy” to the Caribbean nation – an idea that has been embraced by the US government. “The United States commends the Government of Kenya for responding to Haiti’s call and for considering to serve as the lead nation for a multinational force in Haiti to assist in addressing insecurity caused by gang violence,” US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement in August. Blinken added he looks forward to advancing the process of Kenya’s involvement through a UN Security Council resolution authorizing a multinational force in Haiti. During a White House news briefing Tuesday, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he wouldn’t go into the operational details but reiterated the US’s commitment to “support a multinational force that is fundamentally a policing support mission, not a military mission, and one that is in support of the Haitian National Police, not taking over the sovereign policing capacities from the Haitian National Police.” Previous UN peacekeeping missions to Haiti have left a bitter legacy, and critics point out that Kenyan security forces’ conduct has raised some rights concerns at home. In 2022, the US Department of State found Kenya had “significant human rights issues,” including credible reports of “arbitrary killings,” “extrajudicial killings,” “forced disappearances,” “torture,” and cases of “cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment”. According to a White House National Security Council spokesperson, the US is “working closely with the Kenyan government to ensure that any prospective participants in this mission would be well prepared to bring greater security to the people of Haiti and would have a demonstrated commitment to respecting human rights.” “Additionally, we will work with partners including Kenya to monitor and investigate any allegations of human rights abuses once the mission is deployed,” the spokesperson said. The UN Security Council is expected to consider the possibility of a Kenyan-led multinational deployment in the coming weeks.  In the meantime, as the United States creates new immigration programs and hardens its border enforcement policies – including increased deportations, among other tactics – Haitians fleeing the country appear to be looking for alternatives paths. The Biden administration launched a parole program in January that allowed 30,000 people from Haiti, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba who pass vetting and had a US based financial supporter to enter the US legally every month. Haitians are the top nationality taking advantage of the program. Of the 181,000 people who have arrived legally from January to July, Haitians make up more than one third (over 60,000) of beneficiaries, CBP data shows. Panamanian government data shows that since the beginning of the year, the number of Haitians transiting through the dangerous jungle between Panama and Colombia, known as the Darien Gap, has significantly dropped. This year Haitians have also become the top nationality seeking asylum in Mexico.  But many continue to take dangerous risks to reach US shores. From October 2022 to July 2023, more than 5,000 Haitians were interdicted at sea by the US Coast Guard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        africa, brand safety-nsf crime, brand safety-nsf sensitive, brand safety-nsf violence, brand safety-nsf war and military, caribbean, continents and regions, deportation, domestic alerts, domestic-international news, domestic-us politics, eastern africa, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, government organizations - intl, haiti, iab-crime, iab-politics, iab-war and conflicts, immigration, citizenship and displacement, international alerts, international relations and national security, international-us politics, joe biden, kenya, latin america, military, military operations, north america, political figures - us, politics, the americas, united nations, united states, unrest, conflicts and war, us federal government, white house     world                   https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/06/americas/us-haiti-deportations-intl-latam/index.html\n",

                      Conservative hardliners have started to float potential alternative candidates should House Speaker Kevin McCarthy be ousted, as internal frustration with the California Republican has grown, according to four GOP sources familiar with the conversations.  But the rebels still have not coalesced around a single candidate and it’s not clear anyone else could get 218 votes – the same problem they ran into during the speaker’s race. In recent days, some of the names that have been floated in House Freedom Caucus meetings and other private conversations include Oklahoma Rep. Kevin Hern, chairman of the Republican Study Committee; Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee; and Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House GOP Whip. The Washington Post was first to report Emmer’s name, though he told the publication he has no interest in the job. Emmer also told CNN, “No interest in that,” when asked about the report.  Sources told CNN Green was approached by some members about the idea, but Green also said he wasn’t interested. Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has repeatedly threatened to force a removal vote, known as the motion to vacate, but he has not indicated when he might do it, other than to say he is waiting to see how the shutdown fight play outs, though a vote could be triggered at any time. GOP sources told CNN there is no formal mobilization effort among hardliners to recruit a challenger or whip motion to vacate votes. But should McCarthy face a removal vote, the speaker is likely to fight it out on the floor, making the push to remove him more challenging. McCarthy critics believe they’ll have the votes to oust him, even as the speaker has repeatedly maintained he’s not concerned about such a vote and believes he could win it. “You know, I think that members should be looking at for stronger leadership,” said Rep. Eli Crane, an Arizona Republican who told CNN he could support an effort to oust McCarthy. “And you know what, quite frankly, I know that people in my district that I represent want to see stronger leadership. So I’m all about it.” This story has been updated with additional developments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                domestic alerts, domestic-us politics, government and public administration, government organizations - us, iab-politics, international alerts, international-us politics, kevin mccarthy, political figures - us, political organizations, politics, us congress, us house of representatives, us political parties, us republican party  politics                      https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/28/politics/kevin-mccarthy-effort-to-oust/index.html\n",

The suspects charged with murder at a Bronx day care center after several children were exposed to opioids are believed to be mid-level drug distributors, a federal law enforcement official told CNN.  Grei Mendez, 36, and Carlisto Acevedo Brito, 41, face federal and state charges in connection with the suspected overdoses at Divino Niño day care. They were arrested Saturday, a day after 1-year-old Nicholas Dominici died after suspected fentanyl exposure. Two 2-year-old boys and an 8-month-old girl were also exposed to the suspected fentanyl and suffered acute opioid intoxication. According to court documents, Mendez is the owner and operator of the day care, and Brito is her husband’s cousin and a tenant who lives in a bedroom within the day care. Investigators are also looking for a third male suspect who has not been publicly named. Another law enforcement official told CNN the third suspect is believed to be Mendez’s husband.  Authorities have recovered video of that man leaving the center carrying plastic bags that appeared to contain three large square items, which investigators suspect were remaining kilos of fentanyl, that official said.  Authorities believe he has not left the country and is still in the Northeast, the federal law enforcement official added.   Investigators believe the suspects were mid-level drug distributors tasked with cutting fentanyl with other drugs or even household items like baby powder, the first federal law enforcement official said.  They then gave the pressed product to others, who got it into the hands of street sellers, the official said. None of the suspects was previously on law enforcement’s radar, the official said.  Mendez and Brito face state charges of murder, manslaughter, assault, endangering the welfare of a child and criminal possession of a controlled substance, court documents show. They were arraigned and remanded without bail Sunday night. They also face federal charges of conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death and possession with intent to distribute narcotics resulting in death. If convicted on the federal charges, the defendants could be sentenced to up to life in prison. Mendez’s defense attorney, Andres Manuel Aranda, told CNN his client plans to fight the charges. “We feel that she doesn’t have… anything (to do) with this case besides taking care of the kids,” Aranda said. “She has no previous knowledge of any contraband in the apartment. None whatsoever.” Mendez “feels horrible about what happened” and was the one who called the police and ambulance, her attorney said.  CNN has reached out to Brito’s attorney for comment. Children napped near a kilo of fentanyl, police say A kilogram of fentanyl was discovered in an area where children napped at the Bronx day care center Friday, said Joseph Kenny, the New York Police Department’s chief of detectives.  Officials also found three kilogram press devices – two inside the hallway closet, and one inside Brito’s bedroom. The fentanyl was “laying underneath a mat where children had been sleeping earlier,” Kenny said.  “The residue itself … it’s that strong,” Kenny said. “One grain, two grains of fentanyl can take down a grown man. So even the residue itself for a small child, would cause the death.” The investigation turns international Authorities believe the fentanyl at the day care center came from international drug cartels, a federal law enforcement official said.  About 90% of the fentanyl distributed in New York comes from either the infamous Sinaloa Cartel or the Jalisco New Generation Cartel – one of which is believed to be the source of the fentanyl that killed the 1-year-old boy last Friday, the official said. Because of the international ties, federal law enforcement agencies – such as Customs and Border Protection – along with Drug Enforcement Administration officials in the Dominican Republic are also involved in the search for the third suspect. Drug overdose deaths reached a record level in the US this spring. Recent data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows more than 111,000 people died from a drug overdose in the 12-month period ending in April. And research shows opioid-related deaths among children have increased significantly, mirroring trends among adults. A surge starting in 2018 led to a nearly threefold increase in deaths among older adolescents and a nearly sixfold increase among children younger than 5. In 2021, 40 infants and 93 children ages 1 to 4 died from an overdose of the powerful opioid fentanyl. Although deaths among teens are typically related to drug use, deaths among younger children are believed to be related to drugs left within reach. In another recent case, authorities executed a search warrant on a fentanyl operation in Queens where a 10-year-old child was found sleeping on the premises, New York police said Wednesday. Investigators recovered three kilograms of heroin and fentanyl, six kilogram presses, an AK-47 and three pistols during the search Wednesday, police said.  Authorities said the child was sleeping near the equipment.                                                                                                                                                                            brand safety-nsf crime, brand safety-nsf death, brand safety-nsf drugs negative, brand safety-nsf health issues, brand safety-nsf sensitive, brand safety-nsf violence, bronx, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, child care, children, continents and regions, controlled substances, crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal law, criminal offenses, death and dying, demographic groups, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-us news, drug overdoses, drugs and society, families and children, family members and relatives, health and medical, homicide, iab-bereavement, iab-business and finance, iab-crime, iab-daycare and pre-school, iab-diseases and conditions, iab-family and relationships, iab-industries, iab-law, iab-medical health, iab-parenting, iab-pharmaceutical drugs, iab-pharmaceutical industry, iab-substance abuse, international alerts, international-health and science, international-us news, investigations, law and legal system, law enforcement, murder, new york (state), new york city, north america, northeastern united states, opioids, parents and parenting, pharmaceutical industry, pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs, population and demographics, society, substance abuse, the americas, united states        us                         https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/20/us/bronx-day-care-overdose-suspects/index.html\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                         US mortgage rates jumped this week, climbing closer to 7%. The move follows last week’s rate hike from the Federal Reserve, and the downgrade this week by Fitch Ratings agency of US sovereign debt, and of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 6.90% in the week ending on August 3, up from 6.81% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 4.99%, the lowest rates have been in the last 12 months. “The combination of upbeat economic data and the U.S. government credit rating downgrade caused mortgage rates to rise this week,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “Despite higher rates and lower purchase demand, home prices have increased due to very low unsold inventory.” The average mortgage rate is based on mortgage applications that Freddie Mac receives from thousands of lenders across the country. The survey includes only borrowers who put 20% down and have excellent credit. Next up: Employment and inflation data The fixed rate for a 30-year mortgage continued to close in on 7% this week as 10-year Treasury yields climbed past the 4% threshold, said Hannah Jones, economic data analyst at Realtor.com. “On Wednesday, the US Treasury announced it would sell off more than $100 billion of long-term securities, driving 10-year Treasury yields to the highest level since November,” said Jones. “This development, along with upcoming employment and inflation data, will determine how much mortgage rates may rise in the short term.”  Should employment and inflation pick up steam, she said, mortgage rates are likely to continue climbing as markets anticipate further monetary tightening. Last week, the Fed raised its benchmark lending rate by a quarter point, as expected.  “The committee’s statement emphasized that incoming economic data will guide future rate hike choices,” Jones said. “Home buyers continue to feel the effects of tighter policy, which keeps a floor under mortgage rates.” While the Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed’s actions, what the Fed actually does and investors’ reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. Inventory remains a challenge Home inventory remains tight, further hampering affordability. Existing home sales and sales of newly constructed homes were down in June as higher rates have been keeping inventory low and prices higher. “Still-high home prices and elevated mortgage rates have eaten into purchasing power for many buyers, leading to both fewer home sales and fewer listings,” said Jones. “Today’s housing market is grappling with low for-sale inventory amid sustained, though historically low, buyer demand.”   Active inventory fell compared to the previous year each week in July, according to Realtor.com. Many homeowners held off on listing their home for sale, largely in response to today’s high mortgage rates, Jones said.  “The drop in for-sale inventory was met with the typical seasonal pickup in buyer demand, despite affordability constraints, which propped up home prices,” she said.  Homeowner vacancy fell to a historical low of 0.7% in the second quarter of 2023, Jones said, as many homeowners stayed put and home shoppers snapped up available inventory, leaving fewer homes vacant.  “The housing market continues to face more than a decade of underbuilding, and the resulting gap in home supply is being exacerbated by the lower level of existing homes for sale,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       banking, finance and investments, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, commercial and residential property, companies, domestic alerts, domestic-business, economic indicators, economy and economic indicators, freddie mac, iab-business, iab-business and finance, iab-business banking & finance, iab-economy, iab-financial industry, iab-home financing, iab-houses, iab-housing market, iab-industries, iab-interest rates, iab-personal debt, iab-personal finance, iab-real estate, iab-real estate buying and selling, iab-real estate industry, interest rates, international alerts, international-business, inventories, local housing market, mortgage banking and finance, mortgage loans, mortgage rates, real estate, residential property  business                                https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/03/homes/mortgage-rate-august-3/index.html\n",
      "8      3897.0                                                               Fact check: Trump delivers barrage of false claims in first post-indictment address        Former President Donald Trump made a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday night after he was arraigned in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records -- and delivered a barrage of false claims that have been previously debunked.  Former President Donald Trump made a speech at his Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday night after he was arraigned in Manhattan on felony charges of falsifying business records – and delivered a barrage of false claims that have been previously debunked.  Trump pleaded not guilty to all the charges Tuesday. The former president was repeatedly inaccurate when he pivoted to the subject of the federal investigation into his handling of official documents. He also repeated some of his favorite falsehoods on a variety of other subjects.  Here is a fact check of some of Trump’s claims.  Presidential Records Act  Trump, denouncing the August federal search of Mar-a-Lago, claimed that the Presidential Records Act requires prolonged negotiations over the return of documents.  He said: “Just so everyone knows, I come under what’s known as the Presidential Records Act, which was designed and approved by Congress long ago just for this reason. Under the act, I’m supposed to negotiate with NARA, the National Archives and Records Administration.” He went on to disparage NARA.   Facts First: Trump’s claim is false. The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from his administration. Nothing in the law says there should be a negotiation between a former president and NARA over a former president’s return of presidential documents – much less that there should have been a monthslong battle after NARA first contacted Trump’s team in 2021 to try to get some of the records that had not been handed over at the end of his presidency.  Jason R. Baron, former director of litigation at NARA, told CNN in an email last week (when we fact-checked a similar false claim by Trump): “The former President is simply wrong as a matter of law. As of noon on January 20, 2021, when President Biden took office, all presidential records of the Trump Administration came into the legal custody of the Archivist of the United States. Full stop. That means no presidential records ever should have been transferred to Mar-a-Lago, and there was no further talking or negotiating to be had.”  Timothy Naftali, a CNN presidential historian, New York University professor and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library, described Trump’s claim as “nonsense” and said the former president’s description of the Presidential Records Act is “a matter of fantasy,” concocted to allow Trump to “pretend that he’s a victim.”  The law, Naftali said in an interview last week, makes clear that documents Trump had at Mar-a-Lago are presidential records that legally belong to the public and are legally required to be in NARA’s custody. The law provides “no room for debates and discussions between presidential advisers and the National Archives at the end a presidency” about such records, Naftali said.

George Soros and the district attorney   As he has on social media in the last month, former President Donald Trump invoked liberal billionaire donor George Soros while criticizing District Attorney Alvin Bragg in his speech – claiming that Bragg is a “radical left, George Soros-backed prosecutor.”  Facts First: This needs context. Soros did not make any donations to Bragg’s 2021 election campaign, and a Soros spokesperson, Michael Vachon, told CNN that the two men have never once communicated in any way; there is no evidence that Soros had any role in Bragg’s decision to prosecute Trump. However, Soros, a longtime supporter of Democratic district attorney candidates who favor criminal justice reform, did support Bragg’s election campaign indirectly: he was a major donor to a liberal political action committee, Color of Change PAC, that says it spent just over $500,000 on an independent expenditure effort in support of Bragg’s candidacy.   Vachon told CNN: “Between 2016 and 2022, George Soros personally and Democracy PAC (a PAC to which Mr. Soros has contributed funds) have together contributed roughly $4 million to Color of Change’s PAC, including $1 million in May 2021. None of those funds were earmarked for Alvin Bragg’s campaign. George Soros and Alvin Bragg have never meet in person or spoken by telephone, email, Zoom etc. There has been no contact between the two.”  Soros has been a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories painting the Jewish philanthropist as a puppetmaster behind various US and international events. Color of Change president Rashad Robinson called Trump and his allies’ latest invocations of Soros both “antisemitic” and “anti-Black” he told CNN that the attacks are an overstatement of both Soros’ role in the PAC’s decision-making and the PAC’s role in Bragg’s election victory.  You can read a longer fact check here.  Former presidents’ handling of documents after leaving the White House Defending his handling of government documents, which is the subject of an ongoing federal investigation, Trump repeated his false claim that that several other former presidents took documents with them upon leaving the White House.  Trump claimed that “openly taking boxes of documents and mostly clothing and other things to my home” is something “which President Obama has done.” He continued, “The Bushes have done. Jimmy Carter’s done. Ronald Reagan is done. Everybody’s done.” Facts First: This is false, as the National Archives and Records Administration itself pointed out in a statement last year; there is no evidence that previous presidents did anything like what Trump did after the Presidential Records Act took effect in 1981 (beginning with the Reagan administration). In reality, NARA was granted custody of the presidential records of former Presidents Ronald Reagan, Barack Obama and both George Bushes as soon as these presidents left office, as required by the Presidential Records Act, and it was NARA, not those presidents, that moved those documents to temporary archival facilities – facilities managed by NARA.  NARA said in an October statement that it gained physical and legal custody of Obama, Reagan, H.W. Bush and W. Bush’s records, as well of those of President Bill Clinton, “when those presidents left office.” It said of the temporary facilities to which the documents were moved: “All such temporary facilities met strict archival and security standards, and have been managed and staffed exclusively by NARA employees. Reports that indicate or imply that those Presidential records were in the possession of the former Presidents or their representatives, after they left office, or that the records were housed in substandard conditions, are false and misleading.”  In other words, there is no equivalence between Trump’s handling of presidential documents and those previous presidents’. In those other cases, the presidential documents were in NARA’s possession and stored securely and professionally. In Trump’s case, the presidential documents found in haphazard amateur storage at Mar-a-Lago, including documents marked classified, were in Trump’s possession despite numerous attempts by both NARA and the Justice Department to get them back.

Reaction to Trump’s call to Georgia’s secretary of state   Trump claimed, as he has in the past, that he is being investigated by Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney Fani Willis over a “perfect” phone call – which he made clear was his January 2, 2021, phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, in which Trump unsuccessfully urged his fellow Republican to somehow “find” enough votes to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election in the state.   Then Trump said, “Nobody found anything wrong with that perfect call until a book promotion tour many months later. All of a sudden, they said, ‘You know, I remember Trump making a call. Let’s look at that.’”   Facts First: The claim that “nobody” found anything wrong with Trump’s call until months later is not even close to true. The Washington Post broke the story of the call the day after it happened, and there was an immediate uproar; on the day the story broke, Kamala Harris, then vice president-elect, called Trump’s comments a “bald-faced, bold abuse of power.” The day after that, some Democratic members of Congress asked the FBI to open an investigation – and Willis issued a statement calling reports about the call “disturbing” and indicated a willingness to investigate. Three days after the call, CNN ran a story headlined “Trump’s call could put the President in jeopardy, legal experts say.”   It wasn’t immediately clear what book tour Trump was talking about, but it’s possible he was referring to Raffensperger’s fall 2021 promotion of his book, “Integrity Counts,” in which he discussed the Trump call at length in interviews with various media outlets. By then, it had been clear for more than eight months that Willis was investigating Trump’s attempts to meddle with the 2020 election in the state.   Biden won Georgia by 11,779 votes; on the call, Trump expressed a desire to “find 11,780 votes.”   Inflation Trump claimed that the United States has “an economy that has been crippled by the biggest inflation we have seen in more than 60 years.”  Facts First: Trump’s “60 years” claim is an exaggeration, though the inflation rate does remain high by historical standards.   Last June, the year-over-year inflation rate hit its highest level since late 1981, 9.1%. But about 41 years does not round to “60 years,” much less “more than 60 years”. The actual highest year-over-year inflation rate for the last 60 years is 14.8% (in early 1980), far higher than mid-2022 levels. More importantly, year-over-year inflation has now declined for eight straight months, hitting 6% in February 2023 – not even close to the 60-year high.  This Trump claim is an example of how the former president tends to increase his exaggerated figures over time. At a campaign rally in Texas in late March, he claimed – also incorrectly – that the country had the highest inflation in “50 years.”  The 2020 election  Early in his speech, Trump repeated one of his familiar lies about the 2020 election he lost. Trump claimed that there were “millions of votes illegally stuffed into ballot boxes, and all caught on government cameras.”  Facts First: This is a lie; there is, again, simply no basis for it. Trump’s more specific previous claims about supposed ballot box-stuffing by election workers in Georgia’s Fulton County have been thoroughly debunked; there is no sign that any such illegality occurred on a large scale. While there was a tiny smattering of voter fraud around the country, some of it committed by Trump supporters, numerous former senior officials from Trump’s administration and 2020 campaign, including the attorney general at the time of the election, William Barr, have acknowledged that there was not sufficient fraud to have changed the outcome.  Military equipment left in Afghanistan   Trump claimed, as he has before, that the US left behind “$85 billion worth of the best military equipment in the world” when it withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021.   Facts First: Trump’s $85 billion figure is false. While a significant quantity of military equipment that had been provided by the US to Afghan government forces was indeed abandoned to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal, the Defense Department has estimated that this equipment had been worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of about $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021. And some of the equipment left behind was rendered inoperable before US forces withdrew.  As other fact-checkers have previously explained, the “$85 billion” is a rounded-up figure (it’s closer to $83 billion) for the total amount of money Congress has appropriated during the war to a fund supporting the Afghan security forces.

In September 2022, a 15-year-old girl was found dead of an overdose in the bathroom of Helen Bernstein High School, which sits in the shadow of Netflix’s shiny headquarters in Hollywood and a couple of miles from my home.    After more than a decade covering the opioid epidemic, I’m admittedly a bit emotionally calloused when hearing about overdoses, but the story of Melanie Ramos got to me.     About a week after her death, the Los Angeles Times reported that Ramos was one of at least seven teenagers in the Los Angeles Unified School District who had overdosed from possible fentanyl-laced pills that month. Across the nation, there has recently been an alarming increase in the overdose mortality rate among teens, a shameful sign that we’re failing yet another generation as the opioid crisis enters its third decade.       A further reminder of just how poorly we’ve managed the crisis can be found in the details of the drugs found when they arrested the boy they allege sold the pill that resulted in Ramos’ death.  The Los Angeles Police Department chief described finding what were believed to be counterfeit “crude blue M30 pills” containing fentanyl.    In recent years, these counterfeit pills have been flooding across the southwest border by the millions, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, and fentanyl is the primary force behind an increase in overdose deaths.    For those who have witnessed the evolution of the opioid crisis, the cartels’ latest marketing scheme feels either like a cruel joke or some twisted homage to the players who gave birth to the market they now seem to control.    According to the DEA, the counterfeit M30s are fashioned after a generic 30-milligram oxycodone pill manufactured by Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals.   Mallinckrodt may not be a household name like Purdue Pharma, which patented and marketed OxyContin, but it produced nearly 30 times more pills than Purdue in 2006, according to DEA data obtained by The Washington Post. I first came to know the M30 in 2008. I had no idea then that it would be the beginning of more than a decade of reporting on every dark turn of the opioid crisis.  At that time, genuine blue M30 pills started flooding out of cash-only pain management clinics in South Florida and became arguably the most ubiquitous and popular pill on the streets of America.   As “American Pain” details, the most notorious of these pain clinics were operated by twin brothers Chris and Jeff George, who parlayed a Biogenesis-style hormone replacement business into a pill mill empire. Chris was convicted in 2002 for possession after he was caught selling anabolic steroids. The brothers opened their first pain clinic in 2008.    They stumbled into prescription painkillers at what turned out to be a critical juncture in the opioid crisis. In 2004, a trial judge invalidated Purdue’s patents on OxyContin, saying it misrepresented evidence behind the drug’s effectiveness to the US Patent and Trademark Office. In 2006, a federal appeals court vacated that ruling, and the trial court then found that Purdue did not intend to deceive the PTO and the patents were valid. Generic manufacturers such as Mallinckrodt quickly pounced on the market that Purdue’s billion-dollar blockbuster had already proven was extremely profitable.     They offered essentially the same drug but at a cheaper price. And while Purdue was increasingly drawing heat for OxyContin — including pleading guilty in 2007 to criminal charges that it misrepresented how addictive and easily abused the drug was — the generics flew under the radar, at least for much of the American public.  “The generic medication was pretty much the lifeblood of our business,” Jeff George explained to me from the prison where he’s now serving a 20-year sentence. “People that didn’t have insurance could now afford it. This was the real game changer that created this opportunity.”  In the George brothers, generic manufacturers found a couple of pioneers who built an assembly line of doctors to stamp out prescription after prescription for super-size doses of oxycodone. “Handwriting took too much time,” Chris George said.   The M30 dominated the market, and an underground network of users and dealers drove the demand. The George brothers’ clinics became the hub for a whole cottage industry of drug runners, or “sponsors,” who would pay for van loads of “patients” to travel from Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and beyond to get pills that would be resold on the streets back home.   An M30 pill that cost about $5 at a pain clinic in Florida could be sold for up to $30 per pill on the streets of Appalachia or New England.  And with those kinds of margins, the greatest drug racket to hit the Sunshine State since the “cocaine cowboys” in the 1980s was born.    Following the George brothers’ blueprint, more clinics popped up in Florida and, like the Georges, many of the owners didn’t have much prior experience with pain management.  There was Vincent Colangelo, aka Pill Mill Vinny, who had already been to prison for cocaine and heroin offenses. And there was Zachary Rose, who built a pill mill empire of his own.   “It was just a drug-dealing game times 10, times a thousand,” Rose told me. “You get 150,000 pills fronted to you, and by the time you’d mail [the wholesaler] the check, you sold all them pills.”  By 2009, so many little blue M30s were being trafficked between states that the routes became known as the “Blue Highway” and the “Oxy Express.”  Pharmaceutical companies are required to report suspicious orders for controlled substances to the DEA. But remarkably they overlooked or ignored glaring red flags, such as the fact that nearly 90% of all the oxycodone sold to US practitioners in the first six months of 2010 was suddenly going to doctors in Florida, according to The New York Times.  “The individuals who manufactured, distributed, supplied these medications had to have known exactly what was going on in South Florida,” said FBI Special Agent Jennifer Turner,  who would lead the first major federal investigation into Florida’s pill mills.    “They’re following the life cycle of this pill from the day it’s manufactured to the end user. They were having to continuously up the supply to meet the demand. And the demand was very clear as to where it was coming from.”  In fact, according to Chris George, one pharma salesperson even advised him to find a straw owner and change the name and location of his clinic when it began drawing too much attention from local law enforcement and reporters.  Chris George says he took the advice and changed the name to American Pain, which became the biggest pill mill in the country, with five of the top oxycodone-prescribing doctors in the nation working under the same roof, reportedly seeing 500 patients a day.   When I asked Chris George how he came up with the name of his flagship clinic, he said: “It just sounded like a good name to me.”  But it turned out to be strangely prescient. American Pain and the pharmaceutical companies that kept their shelves stocked with addictive pills helped seed an overdose epidemic that has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, including nearly 108,000 overdose deaths in 2021, according to provisional data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  About two-thirds of those deaths involved fentanyl or another synthetic opioid.  The difference between the drug companies and the pain clinics they supplied is that the clinic owners, such as the Georges, paid a heavy price for their role. They were targets of criminal cases that landed them in prison for years.    The drug companies, on the other hand, were largely given a pass. It wasn’t until a spate of civil lawsuits from communities around the country that drug companies finally came under public scrutiny and the true depths of their knowledge about what was happening in Florida began to emerge. They’ve since offered billions of dollars in settlements. In exchange, they admit no wrongdoing.      But every counterfeit M30 that comes across the border is a clear reminder of their role in spawning this epidemic. And the tragic death of a 15-year-old girl is more proof that whatever price these drug companies  – and those who counterfeit their products – wind up paying, it isn’t nearly enough.

More than 7,000 nurses at two major New York City hospitals walked off the job Monday, arguing immense staffing shortages are causing widespread burnout and hindering their ability to properly care for their patients.  The nurses say they are working long hours in unsafe conditions without enough pay – a refrain echoed by several other nurses strikes across the country over the past year. The union representing the nurses said an offer of 19% pay hikes isn’t enough to solve staffing shortages.  This is the latest in a series of strikes in the health care industry in recent years. Those union members who were on the front lines during the three-year battle with the Covid pandemic say the system is no longer able to function with the widespread shortages that arose during those years.  Although tentative deals had been reached in recent days covering nurses at several hospitals, including two new agreements late Sunday evening, talks with Mount Sinai hospital on the Upper East Side in Manhattan and at three locations of the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx failed overnight. “After bargaining late into the night at Montefiore and Mount Sinai Hospital yesterday, no tentative agreements were reached. Today, more than 7,000 nurses at two hospitals are on strike for fair contracts that improve patient care,” the New York State Nurses Association said in a Monday statement. Hundreds of nurses and supporters were out on the picket line in front of Mount Sinai early Monday, filling two city blocks, with the number of pickets continuing to grow throughout the morning. The picket line spilled out onto the street, sometimes blocking traffic. At Montefiore, picketers chanted “Safe staffing saves lives.” Passing drivers at both hospitals were honking their horns in support, bringing cheers from the picket lines. “We’ve been fighting for working under safer conditions,” Warren Urquhart, a transplant nurse at Mount Sinai, told CNN Monday while on the picket line. “We do the best we can every day. There’s something wrong inside the hospital. That’s why we’re outside the hospital.” Cars are honking as they drive by, prompting the nurses to cheer and wave their signs. Doreen Chulon, a nurse in Montefiore’s neurology department who has been at the hospital for 15 years said nurses in her department are forced to work without breaks or time for meals. “We’re burned out. We’re exhausted the next day,” she said. She said the ratio has gone from one nurse for every four patients to one for every six, which is a safety problem for the department’s patients who are often confused or in altered mental states and at a high risk of falling. Both hospitals criticized the union for going on strike rather than accept offers they described as similar to those the union accepted over the past 10 days at other hospitals in the city.  “NYSNA leadership walked out of negotiations shortly after 1 a.m. ET, refusing to accept the exact same 19.1% increased wage offer agreed to by eight other hospitals, including two other Mount Sinai Health System campuses, and disregarding the governor’s solution to avoid a strike,” Lucia Lee, a spokesperson for Mount Sinai, said in a statement to CNN. Montefiore said it was “a sad day for New York City.” “Despite Montefiore’s offer of a 19.1% compounded wage increase —  the same offer agreed to at the wealthiest of our peer institutions — and a commitment to create over 170 new nursing positions … NYSNA’s leadership has decided to walk away from the bedsides of their patients,” the medical center said in a statement.   Overworked and burned out Although the union has agreed to the same raises at other hospitals, it said its major complaint at Mount Sinai and Montefiore is that nurses were being overworked and facing burnout after three years of working on the frontlines, battling the pandemic. They say the hours and the stress of having too many patients to care for is driving away nurses and creating a worsening crisis in staffing and patient care. “We need management to come to the table and provide better staffing,” NYSNA President Nancy Hagans said in a press call Sunday afternoon. The union insists it is striking in an effort to improve patient care. “Going into the hospital to get the care you need is NOT crossing our strike line. Patients should seek hospital care immediately if they need it,” it said in the statement. “We would rather be the ones providing that care, but our bosses have pushed us to be out here instead.” According to Hagans, Montefiore has 760 nursing vacancies, adding that “too often one nurse in the emergency department is responsible for 20 patients instead of the standard of three patients.” Montefiore emergency room nurse Judy Gonzalez spoke Monday of the frustration of not being able to take proper care of her patients because of the staffing shortages. At the Montefiore Moses campus, the number of unfilled positions have more than doubled since before the pandemic, she said. “I don’t feel like I’m doing a service to my patients,” she said. “I have patients who grab my shirt, and I can’t help them because I have to do something else,” said Gonzalez, who has been at Montefiore for 40 years. Gonzalez is a member of the union’s negotiating team. She was on the picket line early Monday after she said she was at negotiations until about 3:30 am. On Sunday evening, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul had urged the management and the union to agree to binding arbitration as a way of avoiding the strike. Although the management of the two hospitals embraced the idea, the union did not. “We will not give up on our fight to ensure that our patients have enough nurses at the bedside,” the union said in response to Hochul’s arbitration suggestion. But the hospitals attacked the union’s decision to reject the arbitration offer and go on strike instead and called on nurses to reject the strike and stay on the job. “NYSNA continues its reckless behavior. The Governor’s proposal would have provided a path to avoid a strike,” Mount Sinai said in a statement Monday. “Our first priority is the safety of our patients. We’re prepared to minimize disruption, and we encourage Mount Sinai nurses to continue providing the world-class care they’re known for, in spite of NYSNA’s strike.” Contingency plans The two hospitals (across four locations) now on strike make up a significant part of the city’s health care system. Together they account for 16% of all hospital beds in the city. Montefiore accounts for more than half of the beds in the Bronx.  The city has about 75,000 licensed registered nurses working at all manner of jobs, so finding replacements for 7,000 strikers will be a challenge. The hospitals have been preparing for a strike since the nurses union gave notice of its plans 10 days ago. The affected hospitals plan on paying temporary “traveling” nurses to fill in where possible and some had already begun transferring patients. A Mount Sinai spokesperson said Monday that it has brought in “hundreds” of traveling nurses and some of the hospitals non-nursing staff has been redeployed. There are 3,600 nurses in the union at Mount Sinai. The overall effect on the New York hospital system appear to be minor so far, according to a city official. Hospitals are said to be busy, but managing, the official said.  But two nurses currently working inside Mount Sinai Hospital tell CNN that additional traveling nurses have not shown up on their floors to replace nurses that are striking, which they say is causing stress for patients and staff. “I don’t know what happened to all of the so-called strike nurses that they were supposedly bringing in, but there’s none anywhere,” one contract nurse told CNN. “I took a risk coming here, not knowing what the conditions are going to be like, not knowing if anyone’s going to show up,” a staff nurse on a separate floor said. “And all these travelers that they claim that they hired – no one showed up.” The staff nurse said on her floor, nurses are assigned to 12 patients when the maximum should be four.  “It’s not safe,” the staff nurse said. “Having 12 patients to one nurse – that’s not possible. That’s very unsafe.” The fire department is monitoring the system, working with affected hospitals and redirecting ambulances to other nearby hospitals. And the New York State Department of Health has posted “strike review teams” at hospitals affected by the nursing strike to review and enforce minimum staffing levels, according to a state official. Montefiore released a notice to staff, obtained by CNN, telling nurses how to quit the union and stay on the job if they wanted to continue to care for their patients. Mount Sinai, which operates two hospitals that reached deals Sunday evening in addition to the one still facing a strike, started transferring infants in the neonatal intensive care unit at the end of this past week. Hospitals facing the possibility of strikes had already taken steps to postpone some elective procedures.  The union says the hospitals will be spending more on hiring temporary nurses at a significantly greater cost. It argues the hospitals should agree to their demands to hire more staff and grant the raises the union is seeking. “As nurses, our top concern is patient safety,” Hagans said in a statement Friday. “Yet nurses … have been forced to work without enough staff, stretched to our breaking point, sometimes with one nurse in the Emergency Department responsible for 20 patients. That’s not safe for nurses or our patients.” A contentious negotiation The hospitals say they are doing what they can to hire more nursing staff. “Mount Sinai is dismayed by NYSNA’s reckless actions,” Mount Sinai said in a statement Friday. “The union is jeopardizing patients’ care, and it’s forcing valued Mount Sinai nurses to choose between their dedication to patient care and their own livelihoods.” Nurses at the first hospital to reach a tentative deal, New York-Presbyterian, ratified that agreement in a result announced by the union on Saturday. It was a close call with 57% of nurses voting yes and 43% against. The tentative deals reached over the last few days still need to be ratified by rank-and-file union members before they can take effect. Strikes have become more common nationwide, as tight labor markets and unhappiness with work conditions have prompted unionized employees to flex their muscles more often at the bargaining table.  There were 385 strikes in 2022, up 42% from 270 in 2021, according to the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations. The US Labor Department, which tracks only major strikes by 1,000 or more workers, recorded 20 strikes in the first 11 months of 2022, up 33% from the same period in 2021. Numerous nursing strikes were among the recorded work stoppages, with many unions citing instances of burnout and health problems among members.  Four out of the 20 strikes reported by the Labor Department last year involved nurses unions. The largest was a three-day strike by the 15,000 members of the Minnesota Nurses Association involving 13 hospitals in the state. — CNN’s Deidre McPhillips, Tina Burnside, Artemis Moshtaghian, Mark Morales and Ramishah Maruf contributed to this report.  brand safety-nsf health issues, brand safety-nsf sensitive, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, compensation and benefits, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-us politics, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, government departments and authorities, health and medical, health care, health care facilities, health care professionals, health-workers union, hospitals, iab-business and finance, iab-healthcare industry, iab-industries, iab-medical health, iab-politics, international alerts, international-health and science, international-us politics, labor and employment, labor departments, labor disputes and negotiations, labor relations, labor strikes, labor unions, medical staff, new york (state), new york city, north america, northeastern united states, nurses and nursing, the americas, united states, wages and salaries  business                           https://edition.cnn.com/2023/01/09/business/nyc-nurses-strike/index.html\n",

      Record-high ocean temperatures are setting the stage for an active Atlantic hurricane season with explosive tropical development, but just one thing is missing: storms. There have been no tropical storms in the Atlantic basin in nearly a month, and none so far this year have come close to the United States.  But the busiest stretch of hurricane season kicks off in less than a week. And with ocean heat running high, experts are urging people to get their safety plans in place and prepare for tropical trouble that could start within the next couple of weeks.  A growing expert consensus is now forecasting an uptick in hurricane activity. An updated outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Thursday called for an above-average hurricane season – an increase from the near-normal forecast it released in May. “We have increased the chance for above normal activity to 60% from 30%,” Matthew Rosencrans, lead hurricane season forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said in a news release. “The chances of a below normal season are now at only 15%.” Rosencrans told CNN there was “moderate confidence” conditions will become more conducive for tropical development within a week or two. And forecasters are honing in on the development potential in the open Atlantic during this time and into September, a forecast that lines up with typical climatology.  NOAA forecasters join other experts in the field that have recently increased their hurricane risk outlooks, including researchers at Colorado State University.  The forecasts are leaning on several climatological factors, but also on exceptionally warm oceans, which provide storms the fuel needed to explode in strength and even undergo rapid intensification. NOAA said sea surface temperatures were warmer than anticipated, and a major factor in increasing the odds of an active season. “Considering those factors, the updated outlook calls for more activity, so we urge everyone to prepare now for the continuing season,” Rosencrans said. Global ocean temperatures are at their highest levels on record. This is especially the case in the Atlantic, where sea surface temperatures are much above average in areas where hurricanes typically form. Notably, sea surface temperatures in parts of the Gulf of Mexico are in the middle 80s to low 90s Fahrenheit – well above the 80 degrees needed to sustain tropical storm development. Water temperatures have even recently climbed above 100 degrees in shallower water closer to the Florida coast.  Even with the abundance of very warm water, no tropical development has occurred in the Atlantic since Hurricane Don dissipated in late July.   Despite the lack of US impacts so far, there have been five named storms, putting this season slightly above the climatological normal for tropical activity. And there have been recent signs that the tropical Atlantic could soon spring to life. Several thunderstorm areas have come close to developing, only to be torn apart by two things: wind shear, which is the change in strength in winds in different levels of the atmosphere, and dry air, which can cut off a storm’s lifeblood – its thunderstorm activity.   Wind shear and dry air have largely won out over warm ocean water over the past few weeks, suppressing hurricane activity. This is not altogether unusual as wind shear is typically strong at the start of hurricane season and gradually begins to ease through July and into August.  But just how much of a reduction in wind shear and dry air occurs headed into the typical peak of hurricane season is in question. Notably, El Niño is present and growing in the Pacific Ocean – an ocean and weather pattern that typically promotes an increase in wind shear and makes Atlantic hurricane seasons less active. Rosencrans said El Niño’s influence had yet to arrive in the Atlantic, but could do so in September. He said there were already signs of wind shear lessening over an area in the Atlantic where storms typically form and that lower than normal wind shear was expected for the season and factored into expectations for an increase in activity. When wind shear lessens and dry air exits, hurricane season will be off to the races with extreme ocean temperatures ready to fuel stronger storms.   Take last year for instance: Two storms – Alex and Colin – had already impacted the US by this time last year, but Colin’s dissipation was quickly followed by a lengthy inactive stretch where no additional storms formed in July or August. But once September arrived, along with it came a quick uptick in activity that culminated in devastating Hurricane Ian slamming the US to end the month. Tropical activity spikes across the Atlantic from mid-August to mid-October due to a relative minimum in wind shear and a relative maximum in sea surface temperatures. This period alone accounts for an astounding 96% of all major hurricane days in a season, according to NOAA.  Even if tropical activity doesn’t pick up considerably in the next few weeks, any storm that does manage to form over very warm water with no wind shear to inhibit it has the potential to explode in strength and turn dangerous fast. And with hot water in place near highly populated areas of the Gulf and Atlantic coasts, disaster can quickly strike if a tropical system is able to tap into that abundant energy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   accidents, disasters and safety, brand safety-nsf accidents and disasters, brand safety-nsf sensitive, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-us news, environment and natural resources, government organizations - us, hurricanes, iab-disasters, iab-science, iab-weather, international alerts, international-health and science, international-us news, landforms and ecosystems, national oceanic and atmospheric administration, natural disasters, north america, oceans, severe weather, the americas, tropical storms, united states, us department of commerce, us federal departments and agencies, weather   weather  https://edition.cnn.com/2023/08/10/weather/hurricane-season-ocean-temperatures-climate/index.html\n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     BMW announced Monday that it would invest £600 million ($750 million) in building two new electric versions of the Mini in the United Kingdom.  Production of the three-door Mini Cooper and the Mini Aceman, a compact crossover, is due to begin at BMW’s factories in Oxford and Swindon in 2026, the company said in a statement, as the sites gear up to make only electric vehicles from the end of the decade.  BMW (BMWYY), which has owned the Mini brand since 1994, secured a “multi-million pound” investment from the UK government to support the development of the sites, the UK’s department for business and trade announced Monday. A spokesperson for the department declined to provide a specific figure, citing commercial sensitivities.  The commitment by the German automaker will secure the future of Mini production in Oxford, where the original classic version of the small car was born 64 years ago. It also appears to represent a strategic rethink. Almost a year ago, BMW told the Times newspaper that it planned to shift all Mini production from Oxford to China for efficiency reasons.  “Mini has always been aware of its history — Oxford is and remains the heart of the brand,” Stefanie Wurst, head of the Mini brand at BMW, said Monday.  BMW will still build the same models at a new facility in China as part of its joint venture with Great Wall Motor (GWLLF), and expects exports from that plant to begin in 2024. It will make the new Mini Countryman at a plant in Leipzig, Germany.  BMW’s stock rose 1.3% following reports of the new investment in the UK.  Government help The UK government funding is part of attempts to safeguard the jobs of 4,000 workers across the Oxford and Swindon facilities, as well as a broader effort to encourage global automakers to build EVs and their components on UK soil.   In July, Indian conglomerate Tata Group unveiled plans to plow £4 billion ($5 billion) into a new “gigafactory” in the UK to supply batteries to EVs made by its subsidiary Jaguar Land Rover, in addition to other British and European automakers.  Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, wrote in a note Monday that concerns had been rising over the lack of infrastructure in the UK to manufacture EV batteries and that money from the government had clearly helped “clinch this [BMW] deal.”  UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said in a statement Monday: “By backing our car manufacturing industry, we are securing thousands of jobs and growing our economy right across the country.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  bmw, companies, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-international news, europe, iab-automotive industry, iab-business and finance, iab-industries, northern europe, united kingdom  business                            https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/11/cars/bmw-uk-ev-investment/index.html\n",

A diagnosis of depression in adulthood could more than double your risk of developing dementia in older age, according to a new study. The study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Neurology, used data from more than 1.4 million Danish citizens who were followed from 1977 to 2018, said lead study author Dr. Holly Elser, epidemiologist and resident physician in neurology at the University of Pennsylvania. People were identified as having a depression diagnosis or not and followed throughout the years to see who developed dementia later in life, the study said. Researchers adjusted for factors like education, income, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, substance use disorder and bipolar disorder. The large dataset and numerous analyses researchers used made their findings strong and reliable, but the study is limited by the unavailability of information like genetic data, said Dr. Natalie Marchant, associate professor in the division of psychiatry at University College London. Marchant was not involved in the research. Depression in late adulthood is often thought to be an early symptom of dementia, and many previous studies have connected the two, Elser said. But the latest study shows a connection between dementia risk and depression diagnoses in early and mid-life as well. “Our results therefore provide strong evidence that depression is not only an early symptom of dementia, but also that depression increases dementia risk,” she said. How are they linked? Although the association between depression and dementia was shown to be strong, there are still questions the study does not answer. “For example, there may be shared common risk factors for depression and dementia that occur earlier in the lifecourse, depression may increase dementia risk through alterations in levels of key neurotransmitters, or depression may lead to changes in health behaviors that in turn increase risk for dementia,” she added in an email. “There is a clear need for future research that examines potential mechanisms that relate depression earlier in adulthood to subsequent onset of dementia,” Elser said. Another piece of the results that could use further exploration is the stronger association found in men than women, Marchant said. “This is an interesting finding, which I hope will be further explored,” she added in an email. “It lends support to the idea that we need to routinely consider risk factors for dementia in men and women separately because there may be different mechanisms involved.” Why get treatment for depression The double hit of depression and dementia may be scary, and you may be wondering – will getting treatment reduce my risk? That isn’t yet clear. The latest study looked at treatment with anti-depressant medication within six months of diagnosis and did not see a difference in risk between the treated and untreated groups, Elser said. More research into if medication and cognitive behavioral therapy with different timing and duration is effective for lowering risk will be important moving forward, she added. Preliminary findings from other observational studies show older adults who took part in therapy that reduced their symptoms of depression and/or anxiety also had a reduced risk of future dementia, Marchant added. Because the studies were observational, however, researchers cannot say if the therapy caused there to be less cases of dementia, she added. “Nevertheless, looking after your mental health is definitely still important for your well-being in the present,” Marchant said. Regardless of dementia risk, treating depression should be a priority, Elser agreed. “Because depression is extremely prevalent and is associated with significant individual and societal costs, effective treatment of depressive symptoms should be a priority regardless of whether they confer risk for dementia later in life,” she said.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Water levels at Lake Titicaca – the highest navigable lake in the world and South America’s largest – are dropping precipitously after an unprecedented winter heat wave. The shocking decline is affecting tourism, fishing and agriculture, which locals rely on to make a living. “We don’t know what we will do from now until December because the water will keep getting lower,” said 63-year-old Nazario Charca, who lives on the lake and makes a living ferrying tourists around its waters.  Visitors have long been attracted to the blue waters and open skies of South America’s largest lake, which straddles more than 3,200 square miles across the border of Peru and Bolivia.  Sometimes described as an “inland sea,” it is home to Aymara, Quechua and Uros indigenous communities and sits at an altitude of around 3,800 meters (12,500 feet) in the central Andes mountain range, making it the highest navigable lake in the world. The extreme altitude also exposes the lake to high levels of solar radiation, which enhances evaporation and constitutes most of its water losses. More than three million people live around the lake, relying on its waters to fish, farm and attract tourists who boost the economy of an otherwise marginalized region. Now the lake is at risk of losing some of that magic.  While water levels are known to fluctuate each year, these changes have become more extreme due to the climate crisis. A record-breaking winter heat wave has led to increased evaporation and decreasing lake levels, according to CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward, worsening water deficits brought on by drought.  Sixto Flores, director in Puno for Peru’s national meteorology and hydrology service (Senamhi), told CNN that precipitation there was 49% lower than average from August 2022 until March 2023, a period that includes the rainy season during which water levels usually recover.  Flores told CNN that by December water levels will be heading toward the lowest recorded since 1996 if the lake evaporates at the same rate as it normally does in the next few months, which he described as “very serious.”  This is part of a “gradual decline” in water levels at the lake in recent years, said Flores, and a recent study which examined satellite images from 1992-2020 showed that Lake Titicaca is losing around 120 million metric tons of water per year, which the authors say is primarily due to changes in precipitation and run off. Communities that rely on fishing are struggling as low water levels adds to mounting problems: declining fish stocks due to pollution and overfishing. Agriculture has also been impacted by drought, with regional authorities reporting that crops have suffered badly in the last harvest season. The vast majority of quinoa and potato crops, both local staples, have been affected, as have oats used to feed livestock. The tourist economy also took a hit after boats used to ferry visitors around the lake were stranded as waters receded. “We are extremely worried most of all because the water level is falling a lot at the moment,” said Jullian Huattamarca, 36, who sells locally made textiles to visitors to the island of Taquile. “We want the tourists to come back, particularly foreign tourists,” he said. The Puno region, which envelops the entirety of the Peruvian side of Lake Titicaca, has long been known as an underdeveloped and marginalized region of the country.  More recently, the economy has been battered by the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and a wave of social unrest. Puno became the epicenter of demonstrations calling for the resignation of President Dina Boluarte, which built on outrage that has developed due to decades of inequality, allegations of corruption, and stagnating living standards.  Huattamarca told CNN that visitors didn’t travel to the region during the protests. “They were a bit scared of going,” he said. Huattamarca said that many people have left the area in recent years, particularly during the pandemic. “They had to, they didn’t have enough money for basic necessities like food,” he said. And recent history suggests that the ongoing drought could push more people to leave their homes, as a previous drought in 1991 caused waves of migration as the subsistence economy collapsed due to a lack of food. For others, such as Charca, the drought is disrupting a way of life. Charca is part of the Uros indigenous group, who live on islands made of dried totora reeds that float on the lake. For centuries, the Uros have woven the reeds into islands, as well as using them to make buildings and boats, but Charca is concerned that lower water levels mean there are fewer reeds available. “It’s going to keep affecting us, there won’t be any more totora, the islands are deteriorating, that’s what worries us,” Charca told CNN. Looking toward the future, it’s hard to see respite. El Nino, a natural phenomenon marked by warmer-than-normal temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean that can vastly alter the weather over South America, is currently underway.  Grinia Avalos, deputy director for climatology with Senamhi, told CNN that these warmer temperatures are expected to continue until at least February 2024. “These conditions will contribute to the fact that there will be lower levels of rain in the Andean region,” she said. For Connor Baker, analyst at International Crisis Group, the situation requires long-term action to protect those that depend on the lake. “While the lake’s fluctuations have been linked to climate variability and natural oscillations, the exacerbating influence of climate change heightens the need for sustained management strategies,” he told CNN.  “Local communities reliant on the lake for livelihoods are particularly vulnerable, underscoring the urgency of addressing the challenges posed by more intense fluctuations in the water level.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     accidents, disasters and safety, brand safety-nsf accidents and disasters, brand safety-nsf sensitive, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-international news, droughts, environment and natural resources, heat waves, iab-agriculture, iab-business and finance, iab-disasters, iab-industries, iab-science, iab-travel, iab-weather, international alerts, international-health and science, lakes, landforms and ecosystems, latin america, natural disasters, peru, severe weather, south america, the americas, tourism, travel and tourism, weather     world             https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/03/americas/lake-titicaca-water-levels-intl/index.html\n",

                    The banking crisis caused by the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank has increased the odds of a US recession, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told CNN’s Poppy Harlow in an exclusive interview on Thursday.  Speaking in his first interview since the failure of SVB, Dimon said that while the banking system is strong and sound, the recent turmoil around the financial system is “another weight on the scale” towards recession.  “We are seeing people reduce lending a little bit, cut back a little bit and pull back a little bit.” While the banking chaos won’t “necessarily force a recession,” he said, “it is recessionary.”  There are storm clouds ahead for the economy, said Dimon. The Federal Reserve’s current tightening regimen, plus higher, sticky inflation and Russia’s war on Ukraine are the largest risks he sees for the economy. But Dimon said he does feel hopeful about the strength of human capital in the United States.  “I’m a red-blooded, full-throated, free-market, free-enterprise capitalist,” said Dimon of supporting local entrepreneurship. “I think we should applaud free enterprise and we should sing from the hills the benefits while we fix the negatives, as opposed to denigrate the whole thing.” Dimon sat down with Harlow after the opening of Chase’s Atlanta community branch. The Atlanta bank is Chase’s 16th branch built in conjunction with local communities and which host free events, financial health workshops and skills training for locals. Community branches also provide storefront spaces for small business pop-ups.  Community banking  These branches, said Dimon, are not charity in any form. They’re good for business. “We need to get money into local communities,” he said. Part of that is as simple as opening a savings account. “A lot of us had moms and dads who took us to open our first accounts,” he said. “And then you see your money go from like $84.75 to $85.17. It was like magic, that interest.” Dimon said that is part of what he hopes to achieve with his community branches.  “We don’t want people to be afraid to walk into a branch here. Come as you are, bring your kids and learn,” he said.  As part of the initiative, Chase has hired a number of community managers with the express purpose of encouraging those who don’t feel comfortable in a bank setting to come in and learn about their finances.  This role, he said, is essential and is often filled by regional, mid-sized community banks, which is partially why the recent failures of SVB and Signature and the possibility of contagion were so harrowing.  Banking sector meltdown Dimon said he isn’t sure if the US economy is through the thick of the current banking crisis just yet.  “I’m hoping it will resolve, you know, rather shortly,” he said.  Dimon said he doesn’t know if more banks will fail this year, but was quick to point out that this turmoil is nothing like the financial crisis of 2008. In 2008, he said “it was hundreds of institutions around the world with far too much leverage. We don’t have that.”  We don’t have huge problems in our mortgage markets, either, he added. “This is nothing like that. And the American public shouldn’t think that.” Still, said Dimon, it’s okay to let some banks collapse. “Failure is okay,” he said. “You just don’t want this domino effect.” Dimon warned that regional banks — and American consumers — should “be prepared for higher [interest] rates for longer. I don’t know if it’s going to happen, but be prepared for that tide.”  There’s a good chance, he said, that rates remain higher for longer — and banks invested in Treasuries need to be prepared for that possibility.  Debt ceiling pain Lawmakers are growing more uneasy about raising the debt ceiling, the self-imposed $31.38 trillion borrowing limit they hit in January. Without new legislation, a default by the US government could come over the summer or in early September, according to various analyses. But talks between House Republicans and the White House remain stalled.  Dimon, who has worked closely with the White House and Congress this year on various economic problems, told Harlow that there would be no default under his watch. “Not as long as I’m alive. Boy, we’re going to keep fighting this one” he said.   Dimon said he believes Congress will come to a resolution on the debt ceiling within the next few months, but that there could be more economic pain to come before an agreement is made.  “You’ll feel the pain before it happens,” he said of breaching the debt ceiling. As a potential default comes closer “you’ll see it in the markets and that will scare people,” he said.  Still, “When I go to Washington, most people there know how serious this is, and they want to get it to a resolution.”  Trump’s 2024 campaign Dimon served on former President Donald Trump’s business council, and while he doesn’t think that Trump’s indictment and the criminal charges the former president faces this week will impact the economy, he does believe that Trump enacted some good economic policy. “There are policies that he did that are good,” Dimon told Harlow. “I think the tax reform actually brought a trillion dollars back to America. The Black community had the lowest unemployment rate ever in his last year because it grew the economy.” That’s not an endorsement, he was quick to add. “That’s not supporting him. That’s just saying that’s true.” Dimon also commented on another potential 2024 Republican presidential candidate, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis. Last year, Florida passed legislation to limit discussions of LGBTQ issues in Florida schools, a bill that opponents referred to as the “Don’t Say Gay” law. Disney objected to the law and the state of Florida has since taken action to strip Disney of some of the powers it had over the land that includes and surrounds Disney World.  Those actions prompted Disney CEO Bob Iger to call DeSantis’ actions, and the law “anti-business.” Dimon on Thursday said that “we support the LGBT community aggressively and actively,” and confirmed that he will continue to do so despite DeSantis.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              With another searing heat wave blanketing parts of the United States this week, many Americans are sweating being able to afford their air conditioning. And often there’s not a lot of public assistance available. Despite the growing concern of heat-related illnesses and climate change, people have far fewer protections from power shutoffs during the summer than they do in the winter. Only 19 states and Washington, DC, bar certain utility companies from disconnecting customers for nonpayment during heat waves, though most states have moratoriums on shutoffs during cold winters. Later this month, Washington will become the 20th state to forbid disconnections for failure to pay during extreme heat.  However, even in states with summertime bans, the rules are outdated and inadequate, consumer advocates say. Some regulations only kick in during very high temperatures — such as 105 degrees in Delaware and Nevada and 95 degrees in Colorado, Missouri and New Jersey — although people can overheat even when the thermometer doesn’t climb that high. In other states, the protections are triggered by National Weather Service heat advisories or warnings, according to a tally by the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate, which was created by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association to develop policies to help low-income families adapt to rising temperatures.  The National Weather Service typically issues heat advisories when the maximum heat index temperature — which takes into account air temperature and humidity — is expected to be 100 degrees or higher for at least two days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees. Excessive heat warnings are typically issued when the maximum heat index temperature is expected to be 105 degrees or higher for at least two days and nighttime air temperatures will not drop below 75 degrees. The criteria can vary depending on location.  The states’ rules only apply to utilities that they regulate, which are typically the larger, investor-owned companies. More than 20% of customers get their electricity from public utilities and cooperatives, which often aren’t covered, according to David Konisky, co-director of the Energy Justice Lab at Indiana University. “Access to cooling is absolutely essential, not just for comfort, but also for wellbeing and long-term health,” he said, noting that this is even more important now that heat spells are lasting longer and nighttime temperatures stay elevated more often. More than 700 people in the United States die from heat-related causes every year, on average, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The deaths are generally considered preventable. At least 3 million customers had their power turned off in 2022 because of missed bill payments, Konisky said. More than 30% took place over the summer, though last year was among the hottest on record. Even if their state bans shutoffs, residents may be afraid to use their air conditioning if they’ve fallen behind in payments, said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “Many won’t turn it on because of the bill,” he said. Nearly 20 million households — or about 1 in 6 nationwide — were behind on their electric bills by a total of $19.5 billion at the end of March, according to the association.  Less federal aid for cooling Another issue is that most federal help for energy bills is used to reduce arrears related to heating, not cooling.  The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program, known as LIHEAP, has about $6 billion in funds for fiscal 2023, which runs through September. That’s down from the beefed-up allocation of $8 billion that Congress provided for the year before. Lawmakers are expected to provide the typical $4 billion appropriation for the coming fiscal year. About 20% of the funds is going towards cooling this fiscal year, according to the association.  But states, which administer LIHEAP, have widely varying policies. Sixteen states set aside at least 15% of their funds for cooling, while another 10 states do not provide any money during the summer, for instance, according to the Center for Energy Poverty and Climate.  Americans’ financial stress will likely climb this summer since the season’s electricity bills are expected to be similar to or higher than last year’s elevated level. The cost is forecast to be a total of $529, on average, up from $517 last year and $445 two years ago, according to the US Energy Information Administration.  But Wolfe expects the cost to jump nearly 12%, to $578, based on warmer temperature forecasts. And in the region including Texas and Louisiana — where some cities are having their hottest summer on record — the tab is projected to rise to $706, up 10% from last year. The association is calling on Congress to provide an additional $3 billion for cooling assistance this summer, which would help about 6 million households. And it is asking utilities to voluntarily suspend shutoffs this summer for those behind on their bills. Some companies institute their own moratoriums during heat waves, even if it’s not required by their states. Florida Power & Light, for instance, has a longstanding policy that it won’t disconnect customers if it’s 95 degrees or higher. Most of south Florida fell into this category on Friday, said spokeswoman Bianca Soriano. Customers who have trouble affording their electricity should reach out, Soriano said, noting the utility has several assistance programs. “If a customer has a hard time, they’re in a crisis, they need help, as long as they call us, we’re going to work with them,” she said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, domestic alerts, domestic-business, domestic-health and science, energy and utilities, heat waves, iab-business and finance, iab-financial assistance, iab-government support and welfare, iab-industries, iab-personal finance, iab-power and energy industry, iab-science, iab-weather, international alerts, international-business, international-health and science, seasons of the year, severe weather, social assistance, social assistance and welfare, society, summer (season), utilities industry, weather  business                   https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/11/business/heat-waves-power-shutoffs/index.html\n",

Saudi Arabia released US-Saudi dual national Saad Ibrahim Almadi from prison, more than a year after he was arrested for tweets critical of the kingdom, Almadi’s son, Ibrahim, told CNN. Almadi was released at 2 a.m. local time on Tuesday and is currently in Riyadh under a travel ban, said his son, who is based in the US.  The 72-year-old had been imprisoned in Saudi Arabia after being given a 16-year sentence for tweets critical of the Saudi government, the US State Department said in October. “He is not free until he is in the (United) States,” his son said. Neither Saudi nor US officials immediately confirmed the release of Almadi and it remains unclear whether the kingdom would lift a travel ban it had imposed to allow Almadi to return to the US. CNN has reached out to Saudi Arabia’s government for comment.  Abdullah Alaoudh, the Saudi Director at The Freedom Initiative, a Washington-based advocacy group, welcomed Almadi’s release, saying “he should have never spend a day behind bars for innocuous tweets.” Almadi was sentenced by Saudi Arabia’s Specialized Criminal Court over 14 tweets critical of the Saudi government that he posted while in the US, a Freedom Initiative statement said, adding that some of the tweets date back seven years. “There are far too many people in Saudi detention who don’t have the benefit of US citizenship to draw attention to their cases. Almadi was wrongfully detained, reportedly tortured, and released only after tireless campaigning by his son and international pressure,” Alaoudh said. “Almadi’s release shows that strategic pressure works, and US officials should continue to press for release of prisoners and lifting of travel bans,” Alaoudh added.

      "8      1075.0                                     The Fed cares a lot about jobs data — but it may be getting mixed signals   According to private payroll processor ADP, US employers hired 455,000 new workers in June. Meanwhile, in its monthly tally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said 105,000 new workers were hired. But for August, the two arrived at similar estimates — ADP reported on Wednesday that 177,000 new workers were added last month, and on Friday the BLS reported 187,000 new hires.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      According to private payroll processor ADP, US employers hired 455,000 new workers in June. Meanwhile, in its monthly tally, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said 105,000 new workers were hired. But for August, the two arrived at similar estimates — ADP reported on Wednesday that 177,000 new workers were added last month, and on Friday the BLS reported 187,000 new hires. It’s not uncommon for ADP and the BLS to arrive at quite different answers. At the same time, it’s not unusual for them to be similar. But they almost never arrive at the same exact number.  This begs the question: How many workers were really hired in a given month?  The answer matters a lot to Federal Reserve officials who closely monitor the labor market. Since the Fed began hiking interest rates last March, officials have been looking for signs of a slowdown after a hiring boom driven by the pandemic recovery.   Desperate to backfill positions employers cut when the economy came to a standstill at the height of the pandemic, employers have had to raise wages to attract talent. But that contributed to higher levels of inflation. While inflation has cooled significantly since the onset of the Fed’s rate-hiking campaign, it remains above the central bank’s 2% target.  Some Fed officials believe more rate hikes are needed to cool the labor market. That could then help slow inflation.  On the other hand, if they see evidence the labor market is on track to cool even more in the coming months they may decide to keep rates where they are absent a spike in inflation.  What’s behind the jobs data discrepancies?  ADP and the BLS produce different monthly estimates of how many jobs employers fill each month in part because they rely on different sources of data.  “There’s no reason why one month’s [data] should look alike,” Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP, told CNN.  Until about a year ago, the objective of ADP’s monthly National Employment Report was to forecast the BLS’ report, which tends to be released two days after ADP’s. But after significant methodology changes a year ago, ADP is no longer structured for that, Richardson said. Despite the methodology changes, markets still tend to view ADP data as a predictor for the BLS report, said Sarah House, senior economist at Wells Fargo. “Old habits die hard among market participants,” she said, “but it’s an independent measure.” Now ADP, the nation’s largest private payroll processor, produces its monthly National Employment Report by analyzing internal payroll data that covers more than 25 million employees to determine how many new people were hired. However, the BLS surveys about 122,000 employers, representing approximately a third of all nonfarm payroll jobs in the United States. Every month they ask the sample group of employers to report how many workers they employed, based on their payroll records for the pay period that includes the 12th of the month. Those responses are used to estimate total nonfarm employment in the country. There are caveats to ADP and BLS data ADP and the BLS don’t have the ability to ask every American if they worked in a given month. So they rely on imperfect statistical calculations that are subject to error. One of the biggest issues the BLS suffers from is falling response rates to their surveys, which reduces the accuracy of their reports, said Erica Groshen, a former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics who is now at Cornell University. Since ADP is a private payroll processor, it does not have access to real-time public-sector employment data. Therefore, its monthly report only covers private-sector employment. That matters because government workers, federal, state and local, account for about 15% of total US employment, according to the BLS.   But the gap between ADP and BLS data does not automatically narrow when comparing ADP to BLS estimates of only private-sector jobs.  For instance, the BLS reported 105,000 jobs were added in June, 86,000 of which came from private-sector hires. ADP reported 455,000 new jobs. That means that the gap was wider even after making an apples-to-apples comparison for private-sector job estimates. Also, ADP doesn’t have direct access to data from employers that use a different payment processing system. To reconcile  that, ADP, like the BLS, uses data from the BLS’ Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages survey to construct a sample that more accurately depicts current labor market conditions.  Another factor that helps explain the variation is that ADP and the BLS have their own ways of adjusting for seasonality. Both take seasonality into account in their monthly reports, so that one month’s data isn’t artificially higher or lower based on hiring demands specific to a certain month. Which gives a more accurate depiction of the labor market?  The QCEW is the most accurate source of data on the state of the labor market, Richardson and Groshen both said.  The report uses data from state unemployment insurance programs that cover 97% of all nonfarm jobs across the nation to estimate with much greater certainty the number of employed and unemployed Americans.  The problem is there’s about a six-month reporting lag. For instance, the latest QCEW report, released on August 23, covers first-quarter data from this year. “You can get the truth, but it’s going to be the truth six months ago instead of the truth now,” Richardson said. That’s why the more up-to-date reports ADP and the BLS produce are valuable, even if they aren’t as accurate. While there’s value in both reports, House said, “it’s one of just many inputs into how I form my view of the labor market.” She said she also studies a slew of other employment data, including small business hiring trends and weekly jobless claims. She said the Fed is likely doing the same. Between the two, it’s difficult to say which is a better predictor of the true state of the labor market. “I think of these as complements not as competitors,” said Groshen. Ultimately, ADP and BLS data “become checks on each other,” she told CNN. And that’s good because nothing improves statistics more than some other way of gathering that information, comparing them and saying, ‘What could we be doing differently?’” In fact, she said that if ADP and the BLS were to blend their two sources of data into one report it would likely provide an even more accurate window into the labor market.                                                                                                                                                                           banking, finance and investments, business, economy and trade, compensation and benefits, domestic alerts, domestic-business, economic conditions, economic indicators, economic policy, economy and economic indicators, employment trends, government organizations - us, hiring, human resources and personnel management, iab-business, iab-business and finance, iab-business banking & finance, iab-economy, iab-human resources, iab-interest rates, iab-job market, inflation, interest rates, international alerts, international-business, labor and employment, labor sector performance, monetary policy, non farm payrolls, the fed, unemployment rates, us federal departments and agencies, us government independent agencies, wages and salaries, worker productivity  business                         https://edition.cnn.com/2023/09/04/economy/labor-market-bls-adp/index.html\n",

                              Hawaii’s Big Island is under a tropical storm warning as Tropical Storm Calvin is forecast to pass over or just south of the island, threatening to bring dangerous coastal surf, heavy rain and gusty winds to the area, according to the National Hurricane Center.  Calvin is expected to remain a weak tropical storm as it swiftly presses westward and passes by the state. As of late Monday night, the storm was about 570 miles east of Hilo with maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. The heavy rainfall poses the most significant threat, prompting flood watches for the islands of Maui, Molokai, Lanai, Kahoolawe and the Big Island from Tuesday evening through Wednesday afternoon. “Excessive rainfall may lead to flooding conditions and landslides over steep terrain, especially along east and southeast facing slopes,” the National Weather Service in Honolulu said.  The storm is also expected to generate swells and rapid surf along east-facing shorelines on Tuesday and into Wednesday, the weather service said in a tweet. The agency warned the elevated surf could become life-threatening in some areas.  Between 4 to 8 inches of rainfall are forecast through Thursday, mainly along windward areas of the Big Island, and 1 to 4 inches are expected elsewhere across the state, the hurricane center said.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            accidents, disasters and safety, brand safety-nsf accidents and disasters, brand safety-nsf sensitive, continents and regions, domestic alerts, domestic-health and science, domestic-us news, hawaii, iab-disasters, iab-science, iab-weather, international alerts, international-health and science, international-us news, natural disasters, north america, severe weather, the americas, tropical storms, united states, weather   weather      https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/18/weather/tropical-storm-calvin-hawaii-big-island/index.html\n",
